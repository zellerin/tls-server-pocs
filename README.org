* Trying build TLS servers in Common Lisp

This repository is to be used to test draft and PoC's of TLS server.

Currently, I have a thread based server in http2, but I want to play with
different options how to build such a server.

For testing I use simple server-side logic: patiently read whatever client
sends, and then send fixed headers and (short) body

** Keeping it simple: single client server
Version in the [[file:single.lisp][single.lisp]] gives up on trying to serve more clients: when it
gets connection, it reads the requests and handles them as they arrive. When the
client sends go-away frame, it closes connection and is ready to serve another
client.

** Threaded
This is what is currently in http2

# Overview

###### \[in package TLS-SERVER\]
I wanted to play with different options for HTTP/2 server implementations. While
I have a more correct implementation of HTTP/2, I wanted something simple to
test different client handling options, as well as speed limits and impact of
different choices.

So this repository implements:

- very simplified (and indeed incorrect in more than few ways) server side of HTTP/2

- protocol, and based of that several versions of TCP server that accept and

- handle the request.

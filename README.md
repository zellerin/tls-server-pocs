# Overview

###### \[in package TLS-SERVER\]
I wanted to play with different options for HTTP/2 server implementations. While
I have a more correct implementation of HTTP/2, I wanted something simple to
test different client handling options, as well as speed limits and impact of
different choices.

So this repository implements:

- very simplified (and indeed incorrect in more than few ways) server side of HTTP/2

- protocol, and based of that several versions of TCP server that accept and handle the request.

- [function] **CREATE-SERVER** *PORT TLS DISPATCH-METHOD &KEY (HOST "127.0.0.1") (ANNOUNCE-URL-CALLBACK (CONSTANTLY NIL))*

    Create a server on `HOST` and `PORT` that handles connections (possibly with `TLS`) using
    `DISPATCH-METHOD`.
    
    `ANNOUNCE-URL-CALLBACK` is called when server is set up on the TCP level and
    receives one parameter, `URL` that server listens on. The idea is to be able to connect
    to server when `PORT` is 0, that is, random port.
    
    Establishes restart `KILL-SERVER` to close the TCP connection and return.
    
    Calls `DO-NEW-CONNECTION` to actually handle the connections after the callback
    returns This function also receives the listening socket ad `TLS` and
    `DISPATCH-METHOD` as parameters.
